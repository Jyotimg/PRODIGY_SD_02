How the Program Works

1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 using random.randint(1, 100).

2. It initializes the number of attempts to 0.

3. It enters a loop where it prompts the user to guess the number.

4. It compares the user's guess to the generated number and provides feedback.

5. If the guess is correct, it exits the loop and displays the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.
