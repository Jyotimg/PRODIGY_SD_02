# PRODIGY_SD_02
 Here's a Python program for a Guessing Game that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. The program will prompt the user for their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low.

- Prompt the user for their guess.
- Compare the guess to the generated number and provide feedback.
- Count the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
